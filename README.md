## Introduction

**nf-core/sammyseq** is a bioinformatics pipeline for the analysis of Sequential Analysis of MacroMolecules accessibilitY sequencing (SAMMY-seq) data, a cheap and effective methodology to analyze chromatin state as described in:

> Sebestyén, E., Marullo, F., Lucini, F. et al. SAMMY-seq reveals early alteration of heterochromatin and deregulation of bivalent genes in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome. Nat Commun 11, 6274 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20048-9. [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33293552/)

:::warning
Please note thata this pipeline is under active development and has not been released yet.
:::

Here is an outline of the analysis steps:

1. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Trim reads to remove adapter sequences and low quality ends ([`Trimmomatic`](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic))
3. Align on a reference genome ([`BWA`](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/))
4. Remove duplicate reads ([`picard Markduplicates`](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard))
5. Generate alignment statistics ([`samtools`](http://www.htslib.org/))
6. Create single track profiles in bigwig format ([`deeptools`](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/))
7. (Optionally) Generate pairwise comparison tracks in bigwig format if provided a list of the desired sample pairs ([`spp`])
8. Generate an analysis report by collecting all generated QC and statistics ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

:::note
If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.
:::

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate -->

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,experimentalID,fraction
CTRL004_S2,/home/sammy/test_data/CTRL004_S2_chr22only.fq.gz,,CTRL004,S2
CTRL004_S3,/home/sammy/test_data/CTRL004_S3_chr22only.fq.gz,,CTRL004,S3
CTRL004_S4,/home/sammy/test_data/CTRL004_S4_chr22only.fq.gz,,CTRL004,S4
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end), `experimentalID` represents the biological specimen of interest and `sample` the library produced for each fraction, it usually is a unique combination of `experimentalID` and `fraction`.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/sammyseq \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

or

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/sammyseq \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   --comparisonFile comparisons.csv
```

`comparisons.csv`:

```csv
sample1,sample2
CTRL004_S2,CTRL004_S3
CTRL004_S2,CTRL004_S4
```

:::warning
Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
:::

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/sammyseq/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/sammyseq/parameters).
